OPENSchool Solutions is the project resultant from the efforts of last year's YSI Program.

Working with the same team as last year. We identified our core values and defined what was the impact we wanted to make.

## A bit of history
OPENSchool was created in Austria. When a motivated teacher realised that the current school system has not changed for more than 100 years. It was then, when that teacher created his own school and create his own concept: OPENSchool.

## The concept
OPENSchool allows the students to foster their creativity by implementing a dynamic model. Each student can decide what to learn first and why. They are assessed by the teachers who define whether a student has mastered or not a competence. The teacher serve as a coach that will guide the students towards the right use of their knowledge in real life.
