In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = an independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance, rules and regulations for the TEDx program.

From August to October of 2019 I had the luck to work as Production Lead for TEDxUCB. A group formed by awesome individuals succesfully managed to organise the whole event. I was in charge of the Talk recordings, Sound management, Stage design and Lighting of the whole event. It was without a doubt a new challenge in my life. Also, I had the awesome opportunity to expand my artistic interests. I was able to have filming sessions with each one of our speakers to make an introductory video for them.

Below you can find some examples of my work for TEDxUCB.
