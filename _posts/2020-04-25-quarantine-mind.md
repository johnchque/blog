In a room somewhere in the world, in the middle of the night, there is someone feeling anxious as they think that this quarantine is not going to end. That the world has no fix and that people do not understand each other. Someone that might or might not have the support of others. Someone that might be facing the quarantine alone.

On the other side of the world there is someone else, acquiring all possible skills, knowledge, and happiness. Doing activities on their own. Someone who does not feel worried about the pandemic. Someone who wants a better future after all of this ends.

Each one of them does understand the current situation we are in, maybe some are a bit biased by a political party or by a certain belief. What links us though is that the world we will live in will not be the same. That in all uncertainty we can mostly just guess about the future. And if tomorrow this virus goes away, our understanding of the world will still develop further.

Maybe the economy will change completely, maybe tomorrow we decide to engage more with sustainable solutions, maybe tomorrow we reconnect with an old friend. What is sure is that we are present at this moment, at this specific point of time. And is for that reason that working on ourselves is really important. Because we have a chance not to only reconnect with the people we love but also with ourselves. Find what we love, what we don't, change for the better, get out of a bad mental state.

Because empathy will save us all. Caring for others and loving them with no conditions will make us feel alive again. And suddenly, one day, we will see this pandemic as part of the past that meant a time we lived in love.

In the end, we must adjust to a constantly changing world. Maybe today, facing the biggest change we will ever see in our lifetime. And if we understand each other, in our fears, weaknesses, strengths, and victories, we will not only find ourselves and our identity, we will see kindness grow in all corners of the world.
