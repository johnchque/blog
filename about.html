				I must say that most of my efforts are created around the idea that each person should have the freedom
				to dream and achieve great things. Due to many reasons we tend to create mental and physical barriers
				that only block ourselves from doing what we want. Sometimes these problems are related to society
				standards and what other people expect from us. I imagine a world where everyone is free to get the life
				they want, where they are intentional about their decisions and they can be sustainable about it. Being
				conscious about the external reality and its need of empathy and love. Taking care of our health and
				being supportive towards others.
			</p>
			<h2>Passions</h2>
			<p>For the last few years I worked extensively on creating solutions that tackle the different education
				problems that we face today. In 2018 I was selected to take part of the YSI program, a program that
				reunites around 24 young individuals to form teams, so they can create impact startups for the various
				SDGs. This was when my interest of sustainability started and since then, I collaborated with
				many friends and colleagues to create platforms, organizations and projects that create an impact in the
				needs of people.
			</p>
			<p> I am also passionate about Personal Knowledge Managament and its importance in allowing people to be
				more creative and be more relevant in their knowledge area. In 2018, I graduated of Computer Systems
				Engineering and my thesis for that degree was to create a PKM platform based on Drupal. Since then, I've
				been developing multiple ways to manage my knowledge and trying to replicate this system with others.
				That is the main reason I want to use my personal website to share my insights about this topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also feel passionate about fighting against racism and discrimination. As that has been part of my
				life since I was a child. See other people going through what happened to me when I was younger started
				a big passion to search for more and better ways of communication. And thanks to that, I am part of many
				communities of people from different industries that are based mostly on respect and support.
