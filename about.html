			<h2>About this project</h2>
			<p>
				I must say that most of my efforts are created around the idea that each person should have the freedom
				to dream and achieve great things. Due to many reasons we tend to create mental and physical barriers
				that only block ourselves from doing what we want. Sometimes these problems are related to society
				standards and what other people expect from us. I imagine a world where everyone is free to get the life
				they want, where they are intentional about their decisions and they can be sustainable about it. Being
				conscious about the external reality and its need of empathy and love. Taking care of our health and
				being supportive towards others.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a journey to intentional growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope what you find in this site is useful for you.
